# Study in the Correlation between Temperature and Income
**A personal project by Alex Yu**

## Background
Economists have observed a correlation between gdp per capita and the average temperature of nations. However, there is both a lack of peer reviewed analysis and no definitive answer regarding why. This R project attempts to reproduce the correlation and conduct a similar analysis using states in the United States. Depending on the results, we can infer possible reasons why the correlation exists, evaluate for causation, and study its policy impacts.

## Data Overview
- Data for U.S. GDP by state was taken from the Bereau of Economic Analysis, U.S. Department of Commerce.
- Data for U.S. population by state was taken from the U.S. Census Bureau.
- Data on average temperatures in U.S. states was taken from NOAA through currentresults.com.
- Data for GDP per capita by country is from the World Inequality Database.
- Data on average temperatures in each country is taken from the Climatic Research Unit, Mitchell, T.D. et al.
