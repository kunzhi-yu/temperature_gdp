# Study in the Correlation between Temperature and Income
**A personal project by Alex Yu**

## Background
Economists have observed a correlation between gdp per capita and the average temperature of nations. However, there is both a lack of peer reviewed analysis and no definitive answer regarding why. This R project attempts to reproduce the correlation and conduct a similar analysis using states in the United States. Depending on the results, we can infer possible reasons why the correlation exists, evaluate for causation, and study its policy impacts.
